# ai-rocket
In this project we'll attempt to train a neural network to land a rocket in a simple physics simulation. We'll add complexity to the problem as we progress. You'll develop lots of new Python skills as we go on, especially object-oriented programming and using some new libraries. Please read through the below for an overview of the ideas. 

# 0. Preliminaries

First you need to install two things: Keras and TensorFlow.

__TensorFlow__ is the industry standard neural network package, developed and maintained by Google. Installation instructions are [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip) but it should amount to running the command
`
pip install tensorflow
`
